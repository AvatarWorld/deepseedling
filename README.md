DeepSeedling: Deep convolutional network and Kalman filter for plant seedling detection and counting in the field

This repository contains the source code and instruction for running models trained for seedling detection. Detailed methodology and results can be found from our paper (Under review with Plant Methods).

1. Prerequisites

1.1. Deep learning framework configuration

Models used in the study were trained using Tensorflow 1.12 and Tensorflow models (https://github.com/tensorflow/models). Please install these deep learning framework before using the source code for seedling detection.

1.2. Pretrained Faster RCNN for seedling detection

Download the model pretrained for cotton seedling detection via the link https://figshare.com/s/b3bc56a13a5a801b0267.

1.3. Source code for seedling detection and counting

Download the source code from this repository to a local computer.
